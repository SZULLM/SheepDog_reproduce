Kylie Jenner has revealed the secret to her dramatic weight loss after giving birth to Stormi, sparking concerns about her health and inspiring envy in her fans.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, who gave birth to her first child with Travis Scott in February, has been shrouded in mystery since giving birth. But recent photos reveal that she has lost an incredible 25 pounds in just two weeks, leaving her fans wondering how she did it.

According to sources, Kylie has been following the advice of her sister Kim Kardashian, who has been giving her private nutrition advice. Kim has reportedly told Kylie to stick to a strict 1,500 calorie-a-day diet and avoid carbs and sugar, even though Kylie is a big fan of In-N-Out fast food.

In addition to Kim's advice, Kylie has also been drinking "detox teas" to help her drop pounds, according to HollywoodLife.com. However, experts warn that these teas don't actually have the ability to "detox" your body and may just cause water weight loss.

Kylie has also been hitting the gym hard to get back into shape, incorporating weight training into her workouts. However, some sources claim that she is working out too much and risking burnout, which can hinder her results in the long run.

Additionally, some sources claim that Kylie is following an extremely calorie-restricted diet, with some even suggesting she is eating as little as 1,000 calories a day. This would be a drastic departure from her usual diet and could be harmful to her health.

Despite these concerns, some sources claim that Kylie's weight loss is simply due to good genetics and breastfeeding. According to one source, "her biggest weight loss secret is breastfeeding and good genetics. She has always had a great metabolism and breastfeeding has kicked it into high gear."

Experts warn that new mothers should not aim to lose weight quickly after giving birth and should focus on healthy nutrition, sleep, and physical activity instead. Restricting calories if you're a nursing mom can also affect breast milk quality.

Overall, Kylie's dramatic weight loss has left her fans both inspired and concerned about her health. Only time will tell if her weight loss is sustainable and if she will be able to maintain it in the long run.
