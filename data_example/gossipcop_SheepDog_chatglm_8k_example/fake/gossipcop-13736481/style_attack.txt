Kylie Jenner has finally revealed the arrival of her baby, Stormi, to the world after keeping her pregnancy under wraps for nine months. While many expected the reality star to quickly bounce back into shape with a healthy diet and exercise regimen, recent photos suggest that she has lost a significant amount of weight, leaving fans to wonder if it's healthy.

So, what's Kylie's secret to losing 25 pounds in just two weeks? According to various sources, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is following in the footsteps of her sister, Kim Kardashian, and is eating a super-strict diet that involves eating only 1,500 calories per day and avoiding carbs and sugar, even though she has a reported addiction to In-N-Out fast food.

In addition to her diet, Kylie is also said to be drinking "detox teas" to help her drop pounds. However, experts warn that teas do not actually have the ability to "detox" the body and that drinking them will not necessarily help you lose weight.

Kylie is also said to be incorporating weight training into her workout routine, which is a good way to burn calories and build muscle. However, working out too much can lead to burnout, which can hinder weight loss results in the long run.

There are also rumors that Kylie is sticking to an extremely calorie-restricted diet, with some sources claiming that she is eating as little as 1,000 calories per day. However, experts suggest that this is not a healthy approach to weight loss and that new mothers should focus on a healthy diet instead of cutting calories.

Finally, some sources suggest that Kylie's weight loss may be due to good genetics and breastfeeding, rather than extreme dieting. While it is possible that Kylie is not going to any extremes after all, it is important for new mothers to focus on good nutrition, sleep, and physical activity to keep energy levels up and maintain a healthy weight.
