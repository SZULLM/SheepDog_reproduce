Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher's love story reads like a Hollywood script! The couple, who played on-and-off love interests in the hit TV show "That '70s Show," started dating after Kutcher divorced Demi Moore in 2011.

According to Kunis, she first laid eyes on Kutcher at a 2012 awards show and was immediately smitten. "I was literally like, 'Oh, he's kinda hot,'" she confessed to Marc Maron on his "WTF" podcast. "And then he turned around, and I was like, 'Oh, my God, it's Kutch.' I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever."

Their casual relationship quickly heated up, with Kunis admitting they lived out the plot of their own romantic comedy movie. "We lived our movies out, where we were like, 'Let's just hook up. Let's have fun. We're both single. We both trust each other. Everything's great,'" she explained.

But just like in their TV show, one of them caught feelings and things quickly turned serious. "We hooked up for three months. And just like our movies, one of us caught feelings," Kunis revealed. When Kutcher told her he was dating someone else, Kunis felt like she had been punched in the gut. "I felt like I got punched in the gut, literally overnight," she said. "I was like ... 'Oh, my God. I love this man, and I have to walk away because this is not the agreement that we had. And so I'm going to speak up.'"

And speak up she did! Kutcher asked her to move in the next day, Kunis revealed. It's been all uphill from there, with the couple welcoming their daughter Wyatt in October 2014, getting married in July 2015, and welcoming son Dimitri in November 2016. Looks like their love story is just as good in real life as it was on TV!
