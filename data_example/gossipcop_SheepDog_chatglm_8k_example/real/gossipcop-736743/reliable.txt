Mila Kunis, 34, opened up about her relationship with Ashton Kutcher on Marc Maron's WTF podcast. The two co-starred in That '70s Show and had a casual on-and-off relationship. In reality, Kutcher was previously married to actress Demi Moore. After they divorced, Kunis saw Kutcher at a 2012 awards show and thought he was "kinda hot." They began a friends-with-benefits relationship but eventually caught feelings for each other. Kutcher proposed the next day, and they have been together since. The couple has two children and got married in 2015.
