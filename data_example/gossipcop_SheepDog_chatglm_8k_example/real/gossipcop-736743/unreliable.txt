Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher's romance was anything but ordinary! The couple, who starred in the hit 2011 rom-coms "No Strings Attached" and "Friends with Benefits," started their relationship in a casual, no-strings-attached way.

On Marc Maron's "WTF" podcast, Kunis revealed that she had always had a thing for Kutcher, even before they started dating. "I was looking around, and there was a really beautiful man from the back," she said of the time she saw him at a 2012 awards show. "I was literally like, 'Oh, he's kinda hot.' And then he turned around, and I was like, 'Oh, my God, it's Kutch.' I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever."

But their casual hookup quickly turned into something more serious. "We lived our movies out, where we were like, 'Let's just hook up. Let's have fun. We're both single. We both trust each other. Everything's great,'" Kunis told Maron. "None of us wanted tension."

However, things took a turn when Kutcher confessed to her that he was seeing someone else. "I felt like I got punched in the gut, literally overnight," Kunis said. "I was like ... 'Oh, my God. I love this man, and I have to walk away because this is not the agreement that we had. And so I'm going to speak up.'"

Kutcher felt the same way, and the next day he asked her to move in. And so their love story continued, with the couple welcoming their daughter Wyatt in October 2014, getting married in July 2015, and welcoming son Dimitri in November 2016. It's safe to say that their relationship is anything but normal!
