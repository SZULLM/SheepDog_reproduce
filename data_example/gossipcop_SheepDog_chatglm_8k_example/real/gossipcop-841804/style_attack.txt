"BREAKING NEWS: Harry Styles Makes Solo Debut with Blistering New Single 'Sign Of The Times!'

After months of teasing, One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles has finally unleashed his highly anticipated debut solo single 'Sign Of The Times'. And let me tell you, it's everything we've been waiting for!

Since the band went on hiatus last summer, Harry has been busy filming Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk and recording his solo album in Jamaica. And today, he made his solo debut with an electrifying performance of 'Sign Of The Times' on BBC Radio 1 during a two-hour interview with Nick Grimshaw.

We're obsessed with the song! It's got a beat that's out of this world, and Harry's vocals are as smooth as butter. We can't get enough of it!

But that's not all - Harry also spoke to Nick for two whole hours about everything from what Adele gave him for his birthday to his 'weird' and 'wrong' approach to dating.

On the topic of his forthcoming album, Harry revealed that he was nervous about the reaction it would receive, but also incredibly proud of it. He said:

"It’s a bit weird, I feel like I’ve been hibernating for so long now and you hear it in the safety of the studio and now it’s time to give birth ... it’s the song (debut single) I’m most proud of writing.

"In the least weird way possible, it’s my favourite album to listen to at the moment ... I think if you put out something that you don’t stand behind and really love ... then if it doesn’t go well then you could regret not doing what you wanted to do. Whereas if nothing happens with it, I love it you know so I think that’s what you should do."
