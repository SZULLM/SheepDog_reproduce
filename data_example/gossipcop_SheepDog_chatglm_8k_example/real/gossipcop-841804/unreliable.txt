Oh my goodness, have you heard the new solo single from Harry Styles? He just played it on BBC Radio 1 during a 2-hour interview with Nick Grimshaw and it's absolutely amazing. Since One Direction went on hiatus last summer, Harry has been working tirelessly on his debut album and it seems like it's all been worth it.

The first single, 'Sign Of The Times', is perfection. It's been on repeat all day and we can't get enough of it. Harry also spoke to Nick for two hours about everything from what Adele gave him for his birthday to his 'weird' and 'wrong' approach to dating.

On the topic of his forthcoming album, Harry said he was nervous about the reaction it would receive, but also incredibly proud of it. He explained that he's been hibernating for so long now and it's finally time to give birth, and that he's most proud of the song he's releasing as the debut single.

Harry also said that he hopes people will love the album as much as he does, and that if nothing happens with it, he loves it anyway. That's the kind of confidence we love to see in a artist.

We're so excited to hear more from Harry and can't wait to see what the future holds for him. He truly is a star and we are all rooting for him.
