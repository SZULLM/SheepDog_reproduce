Harry Styles, previously a member of the boy band One Direction, has released his debut solo single, "Sign Of The Times." The song premiered during a two-hour interview with Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio 1 and has been met with widespread appreciation.

Since the hiatus of One Direction last summer, Styles has been actively engaged in his solo career. He landed a role in Christopher Nolan's war film Dunkirk and traveled to Jamaica to record his debut album.

During his interview with Grimshaw, Styles discussed a range of topics, including what Adele gave him for his birthday and his unconventional approach to dating. He also spoke about his upcoming album, expressing nervousness about the reception it might receive but also pride in the work.

When discussing the album's inspiration, Styles noted that he and his collaborators aimed to create music that would appeal to a broad audience, rather than just music industry insiders. He hopes that fans will enjoy the album and that it will be well-received.

Overall, Styles has been a busy bee since One Direction's hiatus, and his debut single and upcoming album show that he is poised for continued success in the music industry.
